# Screeps
The goal is simple: Unite the server under one flag.

We will probably not reach that goal, but we shall try.

PR's are welcome.

## Notes
For now each bot type has a role with it's associated code.

Bots are built from the `bot.definitions.js` file.

You can change the target number of bots in `settings.js`.
This will probably be fixed later into a levels system.

If you have any questions or issues, well... you know where to go.
